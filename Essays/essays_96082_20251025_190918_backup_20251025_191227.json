At first the monkey pressed the lever randomly, but later he learned that every 10 times he would get a reward. This teaches him on how the lever works and creates expectation in the monkey. Afterwards the lever would give or not give a reward within the 10 press, at this point the monkey already learned about the timing of the reward and the dopamine rises as he comes near to the 10th press, and once the reward does not come the dopamin drops. At this point we can see the outcome of the experiment is that dopamine is not only because of the pleasure of the reward but also the prediction and learning.",

It was noted that the monkey had an even bigger rise in dopamine after the time the monkey got 2 raisins; however, afterwards when the monkey pressed the lever 10 times for a raisin, the rise in dopamine was lower than the first time.\nThis shows that dopamine levels decrease marginally with habits or repeats in the same exercise, with the text highlighting that nothing is ever as good as the first time.\nAlso, we learn that dopamine levels increase with an \"extraordinary\" factor.

Over time, the monkey gained dopamine surges in anticipation of the reward when it got the light that showed that it had the option to work to get the rasin rather than just from getting the rasin, showing that conditioning can work to give us dopamine in anticipation when we know we will get a reward. In addition, when the monkey was given more than just one rasin when it was used to one rasin, it gained a huge surge of dopamine. Likewise, when the monkey had gotten two rasins but got one again, its base level of dopamine from getting the one rasin was decreased. In addition, from doing this on a group of monkeys that had different base expectations of rasins, it showed that gains and losses were proportional and relevant to previous expectation. In this way, a monkey who was used to 2 rasins but got 4 had a similar surge of dopamine to a monkey who had a base rate of 20 rasins and got 40 rasins.\nAll in all, the many experiments on the monkeys showed powerful examples of how losses are more impactful than gains, how gains and their related dopamine surges change based on previous expectations, how anticipation of reward and limited possibility of reward increase dopamine, and overall how dopamine surges can change with framing and make impacts on perceived utility through behavioral economics.",

      "essay_text": "The experiment is that the monkey is trained to press a lever 10 times for it to receive a raisin as reward. When the monkey received the raisin his dopamine levels went up. When he received two raisins as the reward his dopamine levels doubled.\nHowever, with repeated receipt of the larger reward, dopamine response habituated and returned to the original ten units. When the reward decreased again, dopamine levels dropped below baseline. Additionally they tracked the dopamine levels before the experiment when the monkey saw the light anticipating the activity and reward and the dopamine levels were even higher than getting the reward.\nThe findings show\nthat dopamine\nhas a key role\nin motivation, learning, and\nbehavioral adjustment\ndepending on\nchanging rewards. The experiments\nreveal that dopamine\nneuron firing\nshifts from responding\ndirectly to the\nreward itself\nto responding\nmore strongly\nto cues that\npredict the reward. This means that\ndopamine activity\nhelps shape goal-directed actions by signaling expectations\nand guiding behavior\nbased on anticipated\nrewards.",

      "essay_text": "The experiment of the monkey describes the general concept of dopamine when the light turns on for him to go to his room, he has a lot of dopamine because of the excitement of starting the reward trial. As mentioned, a monkey then learns that when he presses a level ten times, he gets a reward which he has a smaller source of dopamine. He starts to understaing what is coming and it is not exciting nor anticipating.\nAnother experiment would be the light coming on and pressing the lever and only getting the reward 50 percent of the time, and it was shown that there is a far greater dopamine. It might be because of the anticipation as well as the greater chance of getting a reward.",

      "ai_feedback": "You did not mention that dopamine increases with more raisins but returns to its baseline level even when the higher reward continues. The passage states: \"the monkey presses the lever ten times and gets two raisins. Whoa: twenty units of dopamine are released. And as the monkey continues to get paychecks of two raisins, the size of the dopamine response returns to ten units.\" This demonstrates habituation.",

      "essay_text": "Originally, they have a monkey press a lever 10 times and at the end he recieves a raisin which gives him a dopamine release. Then they give him 2 raisins after pressing the lever and eventually the 2 raisins give him the same dopamine release as the original 1 raisin. At the end, they have a light to tell the monkey when he'll be participating in the raisin experiment and the light itself gives the monkey a dopamine release even greater than pressing the lever and getting the raisin. Overall, the experiments show that as you complete or receive something repeatedly over time, you receive less and less dopamine over time. Also, the anticipation of the reward gives more dopamine than the actual reward itself.",
