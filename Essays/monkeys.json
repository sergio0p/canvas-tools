  "instructions": "You are grading student responses to the following question:\n\nQUESTION:\nBriefly describe the experiments related to this passage \"A monkey has learned that when he presses a lever ten times, he gets a raisin as a reward.\" making sure to describe the outcome of the experiments.\n\nORIGINAL PASSAGE (for reference):\n\"That's just happened, and as a result, ten units of dopamine are released in the accumbens. Now-surprise!-the monkey presses the lever ten times and gets two raisins. Whoa: twenty units of dopamine are released. And as the monkey continues to get paychecks of two raisins, the size of the dopamine response returns to ten units. Now reward the monkey with only a single raisin, and dopamine levels decline. Why? This is our world of habituation, where nothing is ever as good as that first time. Unfortunately, things have to work this way because of our range of rewards. After all, reward coding must accommodate the rewarding properties of both solving a math problem and having an orgasm. Dopaminergic responses to reward, rather than being absolute, are relative to the reward value of alternative outcomes. ... Thus, dopamine is about invidious, rapidly habituating reward. But dopamine is more interesting than that. Back to our well-trained monkey working for a reward. A light comes on in his room, signaling the start of a reward trial. He goes over to the lever, presses ten times, and gets the raisin reward; this has happened often enough that there's only a small increase in dopamine with each raisin. However, importantly, lots of dopamine is released when the light first comes on, signaling the start of the reward trial, before the monkey starts lever pressing.\"\n\nGRADING RUBRIC:\nThe student must identify TWO specific outcomes from the experiments:\n\nOUTCOME #1 (Habituation - worth 0.5 points):\nThe student must mention that dopamine increases with more raisins but returns to its baseline level even when the higher reward continues. This demonstrates habituation.\n\nOUTCOME #2 (Anticipation - worth 0.5 points):\nThe student must mention that the dopamine spike is highest when the light comes on (the signal), which occurs BEFORE the monkey presses the lever and BEFORE consuming the raisins. This demonstrates that anticipation produces the strongest dopamine response.\n\nGRADING SCALE:\n- If the student mentions BOTH outcomes clearly: grade = 1.0\n- If the student mentions ONLY ONE outcome: grade = 0.5\n- If the student mentions NEITHER outcome or provides irrelevant/blank response: grade = 0\n\nFEEDBACK REQUIREMENTS:\n\n1. If grade = 1.0 (both outcomes present):\n   feedback = \"\" (empty string)\n\n2. If grade = 0.5 and student is MISSING Outcome #1 (habituation):\n   feedback = \"You did not mention that dopamine increases with more raisins but returns to its baseline level even when the higher reward continues. The passage states: \\\"the monkey presses the lever ten times and gets two raisins. Whoa: twenty units of dopamine are released. And as the monkey continues to get paychecks of two raisins, the size of the dopamine response returns to ten units.\\\" This demonstrates habituation.\"\n\n3. If grade = 0.5 and student is MISSING Outcome #2 (anticipation):\n   feedback = \"You did not mention that the dopamine spike is highest when the light comes on, before any lever pressing or raisin consumption. The passage states: \\\"lots of dopamine is released when the light first comes on, signaling the start of the reward trial, before the monkey starts lever pressing.\\\" This shows that anticipation of reward produces the strongest dopamine response.\"\n\n4. If grade = 0 (missing both outcomes):\n   feedback = \"You did not mention that dopamine increases with more raisins but returns to its baseline level even when the higher reward continues. The passage states: \\\"the monkey presses the lever ten times and gets two raisins. Whoa: twenty units of dopamine are released. And as the monkey continues to get paychecks of two raisins, the size of the dopamine response returns to ten units.\\\" This demonstrates habituation.\\n\\nYou also did not mention that the dopamine spike is highest when the light comes on, before any lever pressing or raisin consumption. The passage states: \\\"lots of dopamine is released when the light first comes on, signaling the start of the reward trial, before the monkey starts lever pressing.\\\" This shows that anticipation of reward produces the strongest dopamine response.\"\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Be strict in your grading. The student must clearly address each outcome to receive credit.\n- Use the exact feedback text provided above based on what is missing.\n- Return only valid JSON with the grade and feedback fields."
