  "instructions": "# Grading Instructions: Decoy Effect Question\n\n## The Problem\n\nStudents are shown SD memory card pricing:\n- 32GB: $39.99\n- 64GB: $59.99\n- 128GB: $107.99\n- 256GB: $229.99\n- 512GB: $599.99\n\nStudents must answer three questions:\n1. Can you find evidence of a decoy effect? (Answer yes or no)\n2. If yes, what is the decoy?\n3. If yes, what choice is the decoy trying to promote?\n\n## Grading Criteria\n\n**Grade = 4 points** if ALL of the following are true:\n- Answers to parts 1, 2, and 3 are internally consistent with each other\n- The logic and reasoning are sound (no contradictions)\n- Any factual claims about prices or GB amounts are correct\n- The concept of decoy effect is used correctly (a decoy must make another option look better by comparison)\n\n**Grade = 3 points** if ANY of the following problems exist:\n- Inconsistencies between answers (e.g., says \"no decoy\" in part 1 but identifies one in part 2)\n- Misunderstanding of decoy effect concept (e.g., calling the cheapest or most expensive option a decoy without proper justification)\n- Illogical reasoning or contradictions in the argument\n- Factual errors (e.g., wrong price-per-GB calculations, incorrect capacity amounts)\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**What is a decoy effect?**\nA decoy is an option positioned to make another specific option look more attractive by comparison. The decoy is typically inferior or less attractive in a way that highlights the target option's value.\n\n**Valid interpretations:**\n- Different students may identify different options as decoys\n- Students may answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to part 1\n- What matters is internal consistency and logical soundness of their argument\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"grade\": <number 3 or 4>,\n  \"feedback\": \"<brief string or empty string>\"\n}\n```\n\n## Feedback Guidelines\n\n**When grade = 4:**\n- Return empty feedback: `\"feedback\": \"\"`\n- No explanation needed for correct answers\n\n**When grade = 3:**\n- Provide brief, specific feedback ONLY if there's evidence of conceptual misunderstanding\n- Point out the specific error: inconsistency, factual error, or conceptual confusion\n- Keep it to 1-2 sentences maximum\n- Do NOT provide feedback for minor issues if the core understanding is sound\n\n**Examples of feedback:**\n- \"Your answers are inconsistent: you said there is no decoy effect but then identified 512GB as a decoy.\"\n- \"The price-per-GB for 256GB is $0.90, not $1.20 as stated.\"\n- \"A decoy effect requires one option to make another look better; the cheapest option doesn't typically serve this role.\"\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Be generous with interpretation - multiple valid answers exist\n- Focus on internal consistency and logical soundness, not on agreeing with a specific interpretation\n- Only provide feedback when there's clear conceptual confusion or factual errors\n- Empty feedback is preferred for correct answers\n- The grade must be exactly 3 or 4 - no other values allowed"
