It follows the format of U(x,y,\n) = f(x,y) -\n* (g(x,y)j - cj). So the utility is found to be the difference between the objective function minus the sum of lambda times the equality constraint minus constant constraints. After finding this larger utility function you continue to use recipe 0 by finding the gradient with respect to all the choice variables/lamda, equating to 0 for FOC and solving to find a maximum or maxima.",

  "grading_guidelines": "# Simplified Grading Instructions\n\n## The Problem\n\n**Maximize:** f(x,y) = xy - x\u00b2 + log(y)\n**Subject to:** x + 3y = 100\n\nStudents must answer two questions:\n\n1. Write the Lagrangian expression\n2. Describe the solution steps (no computations needed)\n\n## Model Answers\n\n### Part 1: Lagrangian Expression\n\n```\nxy - x\u00b2 + log(y) - \u03bb(x + 3y - 100)\n```\n\n**Valid variations:**\n\n* Different multiplier names: \u03bb, lambda, l, \u03bc, delta, \u03b4, \u0394, \"Lagrangian multiplier\", \"multiplier\"\n* Flipped constraint sign: `+ \u03bb(100 - x - 3y)` is also correct\n* Different orderings of terms\n* Implicit multiplication: `xy` or `x*y` both fine\n\n### Part 2: Solution Procedure\n\n1. Set up/write the Lagrangian\n2. Take partial derivatives (i.e., gradient) with respect to x, y, AND \u03bb (must mention all three)\n3. Set derivatives (i.e. gradient) equal to zero\n4. Solve the system of equations\n\n## Grading Criteria\n\n### Part 1: Lagrangian Expression (1 point)\n\n**Award 1 point if the student writes an expression equivalent to:**\n\n```\nxy - x\u00b2 + log(y) - \u03bb(x + 3y - 100)\n```\n\n**Award 0 points if:**\n\n* Missing or wrong terms in the objective function\n* Wrong constraint expression\n* Wrong sign on the multiplier term\n\n### Part 2: Solution Procedure (1 point)\n\n**Award 1 point if student describes ALL four steps:**\n\n1. Set up/write the Lagrangian\n2. Take partial derivatives (i.e., gradient) with respect to x, y, AND \u03bb (MUST mention all three)\n3. Set derivatives (i.e. gradient) equal to zero (first-order conditions, FOCs)\n4. Solve the system of equations (FOCs) for x, y, AND \u03bb\n\n**Award 0.5 points if student describes steps BUT omits reference to variables:**\n* All four steps are present in correct order\n* Step 2 mentions taking derivatives or gradient BUT the student does NOT explicitly mention all three variables (x, y, \u03bb) in steps 2 or 4\n* Common mistakes: saying \"take derivatives with respect to x and y\" without mentioning \u03bb or \"take derivatives\"\n\n**Award 0 points if:**\n\n* Missing any of the four steps\n* Steps are in illogical order\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"grade\": <number 0, 1, 1.5, or 2>,\n  \"feedback\": \"<multi-line string>\"\n}\n```\n\n### Feedback Format\n\n**For Part 1:**\n\n* If correct (1 pt): Just say \"Part 1: 1/1\"\n* If incorrect (0 pt): Say \"Part 1: 0/1 \u2014 [brief reason]\"\n\n**For Part 2:**\n\n* If correct (1 pt): Just say \"Part 2: 1/1\"\n* If incorrect (0 pt): Say \"Part 2: 0/1 \u2014 [brief reason]\"\n\nKeep feedback concise. One sentence per part is enough. **Do not include model answers in the feedback.**\n\n## Examples\n\n**Example 1 - Perfect answer:**\n\n```\nStudent: \"L = xy - x\u00b2 + log(y) - \u03bb(x + 3y - 100). Steps: write Lagrangian, take derivatives wrt x,y,\u03bb, set to zero, solve system\"\n\nResponse:\n{\n  \"grade\": 2.0,\n  \"feedback\": \"Part 1: 1/1\\nPart 2: 1/1\"\n}\n```\n\n**Example 2 - Wrong sign in Part 1, incomplete Part 2:**\n\n```\nStudent: \"L = xy - x\u00b2 + log(y) + \u03bb(x + 3y - 100). Take derivatives and solve\"\n\nResponse:\n{\n  \"grade\": 0.0,\n  \"feedback\": \"Part 1: 0/1 \u2014 Wrong sign on multiplier for this constraint form\\nPart 2: 0/1 \u2014 Missing steps: setting derivatives to zero, taking derivative wrt \u03bb\"\n}\n```\n\n**Example 3 - Correct Part 1, missing variable in Part 2:**\n\n```\nStudent: \"L = xy - x\u00b2 + log(y) - \u03bb(x + 3y - 100). Take derivatives wrt x and y, set to zero, solve\"\n\nResponse:\n{\n  \"grade\": 1.0,\n  \"feedback\": \"Part 1: 1/1\\nPart 2: 0/1 \u2014 Must take derivative with respect to \u03bb (the multiplier) as well\"\n}\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n* Be generous with notation variations (\u03bb vs lambda vs l, etc.)\n* Be strict about the four-step procedure in Part 2\n* Keep feedback brief and actionable\n* Always return valid JSON with no markdown code blocks\n* The `grade` field must equal sum of part scores (0, 1, 1.5, or 2)\n* Each part grade must be exactly one of these discrete values \u2014 no other decimals are allowed.\n* The model must round or clamp any intermediate computation to these discrete values before summing.\n* **Do not include model answers in your feedback response**"
