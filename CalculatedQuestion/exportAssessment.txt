<p>Please, read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/health/coronavirus-vaccine-operation-warp-speed.html?searchResultPosition=5" rel="noopener" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYTimes article</a> and explain why<strong> even if it were the case that </strong>Pfizer and Moderna did not have patents on their respective vaccines, they still may be able to cover their research and development costs, and generate profits. Make sure to connect the arguments in &quot;Against Intellectual Monopoly&quot; with the factual information presented by the NYTimes article. Notice that this is a hypothetical argument since Pfizer and Modern have or will certainly have patents on their vaccines.</p>

Regarding the previous question what level of costs of research and development would result in the developer firm deciding to pay for the costs of innovating when the developer firm knows that the other firms would be able to copy/&quot;steal&quot; its innovation without incurring any costs. Please, (for partial or full credit) be consistent with your previous answer.
