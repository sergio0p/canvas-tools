  - Error handling with informative messages
- **Interactive Loop**: Process multiple assignment groups in one session

## Requirements

## API Details

### Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/v1/users/self/favorites/courses` - Fetch starred courses
- `GET /api/v1/courses/:id/assignment_groups?include[]=assignments` - Get assignment groups with assignments
- `PUT /api/v1/courses/:id/assignments/:assignment_id` - Update assignment to non-graded

### Assignment Update

When converting to non-graded, the script sets:
```python
{
    'assignment[grading_type]': 'not_graded',
    'assignment[points_possible]': ''
}
```

## Error Handling

The script handles various error scenarios:

- **No API Token**: Exits with instructions to set token
- **No Favorited Courses**: Prompts to star courses in Canvas
- **No Assignment Groups**: Notifies if course has no groups
- **No Assignments in Group**: Skips processing if group is empty
- **API Errors**: Displays HTTP errors with response details
- **Network Issues**: Catches connection errors

## Code Structure

```python
class CanvasAssignmentManager:
    def __init__()                          # Initialize with API token
    def _get_api_token()                    # Retrieve token from keychain
    def _make_request()                     # Make API requests with error handling
    def get_teaching_courses()              # Fetch favorited courses
    def display_courses()                   # Show course menu
    def select_course()                     # Handle course selection
    def get_assignment_groups()             # Fetch groups with assignments
    def display_assignment_groups()         # Show group menu
    def select_assignment_group()           # Handle group selection
    def get_assignments_in_group()          # Fetch specific group assignments
    def confirm_action()                    # Get user confirmation
    def make_assignment_non_graded()        # Convert single assignment
    def process_assignment_group()          # Process entire group
    def run()                               # Main application loop
```

## Customization

### Change Canvas Instance

Edit the API_BASE constant:

```python
API_BASE = "https://your-institution.instructure.com/api/v1"
```

### Show All Courses (Not Just Favorites)

Replace the `get_teaching_courses()` method to use:

```python
url = f"{API_BASE}/courses"
params = {
    'enrollment_type': 'teacher',
    'enrollment_state': 'active',
    'per_page': 100
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No favorited courses found"
- Star courses in Canvas by clicking the star icon on the course card

### "HTTP ERROR: 401"
- API token is invalid or expired
- Generate a new token and update keychain

### "No assignment groups found"
- Course may not have any assignment groups created
- Check Canvas course settings

### Assignments not converting
- Verify you have instructor/TA permissions
- Check Canvas permissions for assignment editing

## Safety Notes

- **Backup First**: Consider exporting gradebook before bulk changes
- **Test on Practice Course**: Try on a test course first
- **Confirmation Required**: Script requires explicit "yes" confirmation
- **Irreversible**: Converting to non-graded removes point values
